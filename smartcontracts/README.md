# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```

## Project Setup

Add a `.env` file to the root of this directory with the following contents:

```shell
SEPOLIA_API_URL = https://sepolia.infura.io/v3/<INFURA API KEY>
PRIVATE_KEY = <ETHEREUM PRIVATE KEY>
ETHERSCAN_API_KEY = <ETHERSCAN API KEY>
```
